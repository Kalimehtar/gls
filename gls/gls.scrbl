@section{Introduction. Purpose of the library}

This library allows to make generics on arbitrary predicates. Generic is a function,
that called with different dunction bodies, depending upon its argument types, and these
bodies may be changed at any time. Classic implementation is
@(hyperlink "https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOS" "CLOS").

@racket[gls] differs from CLOS (and Swindle): it allows not only classes as dispatching condititons, but
any possible predicates. For example, classic
@(hyperlink "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle-ellipse_problem" "circle-ellipse problem")
with @racket[gls] may be solved as

@(interaction
  (require gls)
  (struct ellipse (h v) #:mutable)
  (define circle? (and? ellipse? (Î» (e) (= (ellipse-h e) (ellipse-v e)))))
  (define (circle r) (ellipse r r))
  (defgeneric circle-radius
    (method ([c circle?])
       (ellipse-h c)))
  (define c (circle 10))
  (circle-radius c)
  (set-ellipse-v! c 20)
  (circle-radius c))

So @racket[c] is a circle only when both axis are equal.
